Simple Arduino and PIR motion sensor that can detect movement. An LED will light up when movement is detected.

Introducing the PIR Motion Sensor The PIR motion sensor is ideal to detect movement. PIR stand for “Passive Infrared”. Basically, the PIR motion sensor measures infrared light from objects in its field of view.

So, it can detect motion based on changes in infrared light in the environment. It is ideal to detect if a human has moved in or out of the sensor range.
